\title{How to add a custom image-based dynamic model into CASToR}
\maketitle

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Foreword for developers}

Before adding some code to CASToR, it is highly recommended to read the general documentation \textit{CASToR\_\_general\_documentation.pdf} to get a good
picture of the project, as well as the programming guidelines \textit{CASToR\_HowTo\_\_programming\_guidelines.pdf}. Also, the philosophy about adding new
modules in CASToR (\textit{e.g.} projectors, optimizers, deformations, dynamic models, etc) is fully explained in \textit{CASToR\_HowTo\_\_add\_new\_modules.pdf}.
Finally, the doxygen documentation is a very good resource to help understanding the code architecture.


%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Summary}

This HowTo guide describes how to add a new dynamic model class for image-based dynamic applications such as kinetic modeling or any temporal regularization. The model could be applied to the images of chronological frames of a dynamic acquisition (simply refered by \textit{frames} in the CASToR nomenclature and in this document) or to the images of respiratory and/or cardiac gates of a gated dataset (whose events belonging to the same state (i.e phase or amplitude) of a physiological motion have been previously regrouped into several \textit{gates}). 

\bigskip
This guide begins with a general description of the dynamic model part of the CASToR architecture that explains the chosen implementation (section \ref{s_archi}). The implemented models and their parameters are presented in section \ref{s_implementedModels}. Section \ref{s_dmodel_toolkit} briefly introduces the toolkit used to perform post-reconstruction kinetic fitting. Then follows a step-by-step guide that explains how to add a new dynamic model by simply adding a new class with few mandatory requirements (section \ref{section_add_own_dynamic_model}). The last section (\ref{section_Meta-data command line options}) lists command-line-options linked to dynamic reconstruction.

\section{The dynamic module architecture}
\label{s_archi}

The dynamic model part of the code is based on 2 main classes: \textit{oDynamicModelManager} and
\textit{vDynamicModel}, located in the dynamic subfolder. If enabled with the \textit{-dynamic-model} command line option, the main program will instantiate and initialize the \textit{oDynamicModelManager}, which is in charge of reading command line options and instantiating the child of \textit{vDynamicModel}. It will call the \textit{InitializeSpecific()} function of each dynamic module. To get some help on how to use it and a list of the implemented processing modules, execute the program with the option -help-dynamic-model. 

During the iterative reconstruction process, at the end of each iteration/subset loop, the \textit{ApplyDynamicModel()} function of the manager will call the \textit{EstimateModel()} and \textit{EstimateImage()} functions of the \textit{vDynamicModel}. 

\begin{description}
  \item[EstimateModel():]
This function will call the \textit{EstimateModelParameters()} function which is implemented by the child class. This function is dedicated to the estimation of any parameters of the model. This step can be skipped by setting the \textit{No\_parameters\_update} tag to 1 in the dynamic model configuration file.

  \item[EstimateImage():]
This function will call the \textit{EstimateImageWithModel()} function which is implemented by the child class. This function is dedicated to the recomputation of the activity image using the estimated parametric images estimated with \textit{EstimateModelParameters()}. In other words, the time-activity curves of each voxel will be recomposed using the model functions and the estimated parameters. This step can be skipped by setting the \textit{No\_image\_update} tag to 1 in the dynamic model configuration file. Additionally, this process can be enabled after a \textit{x} number of iterations by setting the following tag in the configuration file: \textit{Number\_of\_iterations\_before\_image\_update: x}.
\end{description}

The estimated parametric images will be saved on disk at each iteration/subset in a similar way than regular reconstructed image, depending on the \textit{-it} command line option. This can however be disabled by setting the \textit{Save\_parametric\_images} tag to 0 in the configuration file.

Depending on the implementation, some dynamic models store the information about non-realistic estimated value or issues during the estimation in specific voxels. These "blacklisted" voxels are usually ignored during the parameters estimation and/or the image recomposition steps in order to avoid that wrong values get propagated into the images. The image of these voxels can be written on disk by setting the \textit{Save\_blacklisted\_voxels\_images} tag to 1 in the configuration file.

Depending on the implementation, a specific mask can be provided in order to indicate voxel in which the dynamic model should be applied or not. As for any images with CASToR, the image file format of the mask must be interfile, and the path to the header must be provided with the following field: \textit{Mask: path/to/image/header}.

If you wish to implement a new dynamic model, please have a look to the section \ref{section_add_own_dynamic_model}.

\section{Implemented dynamic models}
\label{s_implementedModels}

The \textbf{-dynamic-model} command line option allows to specify a dynamic model and its potential configuration parameters (see details in section \ref{section_Meta-data command line options}). The following dynamig models are currently implemented. More details about the available dynamic models and information regarding their initialization can be displayed using the command -help-dynamic-model: 

\begin{description}
  \item[LinearModel:]
This class implements a general linear dynamic model applied between the images of a dynamic acquisition. The model is applied on a voxel-by-voxel basis between the images of the frames and/or respiratory/cardiac gates. Section \ref{ss_lmodel} describes how to use this model and its parameters.

\subsection{iLinearModel:}
\label{ss_lmodel}


This class implements a general linear dynamic model applied between the images of a dynamic acquisition. The model is applied on a voxel-by-voxel basis between either the images of the frames or respiratory / cardiac gates. Several models could be used simultaneously on 5D/6D datasets (i.e dynamic gated acquisitions splitted in chronological time frames, or dual-gated acquisitions). At each iteration and subset, the parametric images of the model, and optionally the basis functions of the model, are estimated using the nested EM algorithm. Several variables control different parameters of the algorithm, such as the number of iterations of EM iterations for the model, the ratio of parametric images updates before basis function updates. This class must be initialized using a configuration file with the following command-line option:

\bigskip
\verb| -dynamic-model LinearModel:/path/to/conf/file|
\bigskip

The configuration file must contain one (or several) couple(s) of BEGIN/END keywords to define at which dynamic level of modelling the user-provided parameters must be applied:
\begin{itemize}
\item DYNAMIC FRAMING / ENDDF : model related to the chronological dynamic frames of the dynamic dataset
\item RESPIRATORY GATING / ENDRG : model related to the respiratory gates of the dynamic dataset
\item CARDIAC GATING / ENDCG : model related to the cardiac gates of the dynamic dataset
\end{itemize}


The following parameters could be defined inside these keywords to set a dynamic model at a specific dynamic level:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Number\_basis\_functions: x}	(mandatory)

The number \textit{x} of basis functions (and parametric images) defined in the model

\item \textbf{Basis\_functions: list}	(mandatory)

Basis function initial values (list of coefficients for each frame or gate, separated by commas. Each functions must be entered on new lines)

\item \textbf{Optimisation\_method: x}	(mandatory)

Select the optimisation method to be used for voxel-wise parameter estimation. The different available methods are:
\begin{description}
\item \texttt{x=0: Direct}

Implementation of basis functions side by system matrix in each tomographic iterative loop (/!\ Currently not compatible with motion correction)

\item \texttt{x=1: Nested EM}

Parameters estimation using the nested-EM method. This method integrates an EM-like estimation of the parametric image using the following equation, where $\widehat{x}_{v,t}$ represents the intermediate estimation of the image.

\begin{equation}
\widehat{\theta}_{vf}^{n+1} = \frac{\widehat{\theta}_{vf}^n}{\sum_{t}B_{tf}} \sum_{t} B_{tf} \frac{\widehat{x}_{v,t}}{x_{v,t}(  \widehat{\theta}_{v}^n)   }
\label{eq_nested_EM}
\end{equation}

where $\theta$, B and X are the parameters of the model, basis functions of the model, and images respectively. The indices v, f, t and n refer to the voxels, model basis functions, temporal dimension (either frame or gate) and iteration respectively. A data-driven approach can be set using the following

The number of sub-iteration of the nested-EM is definined with the keyword \textit{Number\_model\_iterations: x}, where x represents the number of iteration (as n in the equation \ref{eq_nested_EM}).

A data-driven approach can be set, where the coefficient of the basis functions are estimated along with the parameters. In this case, the iteration n defines the number of cycle. A cycle which contains several update of the parametric images, followed by several updates of the basis function coefficients (by defaut, one update of each is performed in one cycle). The following parameters can be used to customize the cycles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Basis\_function\_update\_ratio: x. Number of updates of parametric images and basis functions inside a cycle. Cycles consist in x iterations of the parametric images, following by x iterations of the basis functions. Only the parametric images are updated by default.
\item Basis\_function\_start\_ite : x. Starting \textbf{reconstruction} iteration (not nested-EM iteration) for the update of basis functions. If negative, no update of the basis functions is performed (only parametric images are updated by default).
\end{itemize}

\item \texttt{x=2: NNLS:} Iterative non-negative Least-Square (frame model only). This code is derived from Turku PET center libraries, authors: Vesa Oikonen and Kaisa Sederholm (http://www.turkupetcentre.net/petanalysis/index.html). Based on C.L. Lawson and R.J. Hanson, Solving Least Squares Problems. Weights can be added for WLS with the following keywords:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number\_weight\_values: x. Enter the number of weights to be applied for each dynamic frame for performing WLS optimisation.
\item Weight\_values: x. Enter the weight values to be applied for each dynamic frame ( within DYNAMIC FRAMING/ENDDF) on one single line, separated by ','.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\item \textbf{Parametric\_images\_init: path} (optional)

Parametric images initialization using an interfile image located at the provided \textit{path}. Without initialization, all voxel will be set to 1 by default)

\end{itemize}

Listing \ref{list_lmodel_init} below presents an example of configuration file to initialize 2 dynamic models. The first model is applied between frames, the second one between respiratory gates images.

\label{eq_1TCM_CT}
\end{equation}

where $C_{pet}(t)$ denotes the image value in voxel for frame $t$, and $C_t$ and $C_p$ are activity concentration in tissue and plasma respectively. The model estimates $K_1$, $k_2$ and $V_a$ parametric images.

\item $X$ = model matrix ($C_p$, $I_{c_p}$, $C_{pet}$)
\item $W$ = weights vector (frame duration)
\item $t$ = Ridge constant
\item $Rw$ = Ridge weights
\item $Rm$ = Ridge means
\end{description}



\item \textbf{Bounds:} (optional) Upper / Lower Bounds for each 3 parameters, to define for each parameter ridge means $mr=(Max+Min)/2$, and weights $wr=1/(Max-Min)^2$.

They must be provided as in the following syntax:

\bigskip
Bounds: $K_1Max$, $K_1Min$, $k_2Max$, $k_2Min$, $V_aMax$, $V_aMin$.
\bigskip

Default values:
\begin{description}
\item K1(Max,Min) = 0.1, 0.

\item Va(Max,Min) = 1. , 0.
\end{description}

\item \textbf{VA\_image: path/to/image} (optional) Path to an interfile image containing the arterial volume fraction value in tissue for each voxel, only K1 and k2 rate constants will be estimated if such image is provided (Default: All parameters are estimated).

\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Command line options:}
\label{sss_1TCM_list}

   The one-tissue compartment model initialization can be directly made from the command line options. The model just requires the samples of the plasma input curve, separated by commas:


\bigskip
\texttt{-dynamic-model \_1TCM,  $C_{p,tf_1}$, $C_{p,tf_2}$, ..., $C_{p,tf_n}$}
\bigskip



All other options will be set to default. The optimisation algorithm will be NNLS, the integration method for TAC will be WPO.

\subsection{Parameters common to all dynamic model:} 
\label{ss_common_parameters}

The following keywords are optional and common to each dynamic model (Dynamic frame, Respiratory gating or Cardiac gating). They control the main functions dedicated to the estimation of the model parameters, and the re-estimation of the image using the model:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Number\_of\_iterations\_before\_image\_update: x}  

Set a number \textit{x} of iteration to reach before using the model to generate the images at each frames/gates (Default x ==  0) 
   
\item \textbf{No\_image\_update: x } 

If \textit{x} set to 1, the reconstructed images for the next iteration/subset are not reestimated using the model (the code just performs standard independent reconstruction of each frames/gates) (Default x = 0).       
          
\item \textbf{No\_parameters\_update: x} 

If set to 1, the parameters / functions of the model are not estimated with the image (this could be used to test The EstimateImageWithModel() function with specific user-provided parametric images) (Default x = 0).
   
\item \textbf{Save\_parametric\_images : x } 

Enable (1)/Disable(0) saving parametric images on disk (Default x == 1)  

\item \textbf{Save\_blacklisted\_voxels\_images : x } 

Enable (1)/Disable(0) saving blacklisted voxels images on disk (Default x == 0)  

\item \textbf{Mask : x } 

Path to an interfile image containing a mask indicating if the model must be applied (1) or not (0) in each voxel (Default: model applies everywhere)  

\end{itemize}

\section{castor-imageDynamicTools toolkit}
\label{s_dmodel_toolkit}

This utility can be used to apply any of the dynamic model implemented in CASToR over a set of dynamic images. This can be used either to test a dynamic model, or to apply the model as a post-reconstruction processing. 

\bigskip
As with \textit{ castor-recon}, the dynamic model should be called with \textit{-dynamic-model}. The set of dynamic image (either a dynamic image, or the metaheader of a set of dynamic images), or a dynamic image must be called with the \textit{-i} option. 

\bigskip
Please look at section 8 of the general documentation to have a description of the dynamic image interfile format. Additionally, the \textit{-h} option will display all command line options provided by this utility.

\section{Add your own dynamic model}
\label{section_add_own_dynamic_model}

\subsection{Basic concept}


The addition of a new dynamic model mostly require to implement these two functions. Note that these functions can be individually enabled/disabled depending on the values of some parameters implemented by \textit{vDynamicModel} specific to vDynamicModel as specified in section \ref{ss_common_parameters}.


The addition of a new image-based dynamic model require to build a specific class that inherits from the abstract class \textit{vDynamicModel}. Then, one just has to implement a set of pure virtual functions for the initialization and application of the model. Please refer to the \textit{CASToR\_HowTo\_\_add\_new\_modules.pdf} guide in order to fill up the mandatory parts of adding a new module; namely the auto-inclusion mechanism, the interface-related functions and the management functions. To ease the implementation, a template class is provided in the source code and already implements all the squeleton. Basically, one will have to change the name of the class and fill the related functions up in his own code. The actual files are \textit{include/dynamic/iDynamicModelTemplate.hh} and \textit{src/dynamic/iDynamicModelTemplate.cc} and are already part of the source code. Right below are some instructions to help fill the specific pure virtual projection functions of a dynamic model.
\bigskip



\subsection{Implementation of the dynamic model functions}

Several mandatory functions should be implemented (or return an error by default) in a new dynamic model class :

\begin{description}
\item \textbf{ShowHelp()}: Simply output some help and guidance to describe what the dynamic model does and how to use it.

\item \textbf{ReadAndCheckOptionsList()}: Implement here the reading of any options specific to this dynamic model passed through the argument \texttt{const string\& a\_listOptions}. The user can make use of the \textit{ReadStringOption()} function to parse the list of parameters. If the function is not mandatory (e.g initialization of the model using a file is required rather than with command-line parameters), just send an error message and return 1.

\item \textbf{ReadAndCheckConfigurationFile()}: Implement here the reading of any configuration file specific to this dynamic model, passed through the argument \texttt{const string\& a\_fileOptions}. The user can make use of the \textit{ReadDataASCIIFile()} function to read data from a file. If the function is not mandatory (e.g initialization of the model using command line options is required rather than with a file), just send an error message and return 1.

\item \textbf{CheckParameters()}: Use this function to check if the private parameters of your class have correctly been initialized. It might be a good idea to initialize all private parameters in the constructor with default erroneous value to properly check their initialization.

\item \textbf{InitializeSpecific()}: Use this function to Instanciate/Initialize any member variables/arrays after the parameters have been checked in the previous function.
  
\item \textbf{EstimateModelParameters()}: The estimation of the model parameters and parametric images must be implemented here, with the help of any private functions if required. The \textit{ap\_ImageS} parameter allows to access the image matrices in the oImageSpace class. The current estimation of the image \textit{m4p\_image} can be accessed from there. It contains 4 dimensions in order to access to any dynamic level : 

$ap\_ImageS->m4p\_image[fr][rg][cg][v]$ \\
fr = time frames \\
rg = respiratory gates \\
cg = cardiac gates \\
 v = actual voxel of the 3D volume

\item \textbf{EstimateImageWithModel()}: This function can be used to generate the serie of dynamic images from the model (i.e, the image matrix $ap\_ImageS->m4p\_image$), after estimation of the model parameters in EstimateModelParameters(). It is called right after EstimateModelParameters()

All information and the tools needed to implement these functions are fully described in the template source file \textit{src/dynamic/iDynamicModelTemplate.cc}, so please refer to it.

\section{Meta-data command line options}
\label{section_Meta-data command line options}
List of the different set of options related to image-based dynamic models :
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{-frm} \textit{path/to/file}: Give the framing details for the reconstruction where 'list' is a list of frame start times, separated with commas. Duration for each frame can also be specified using a colon after the frame start time. When no duration is specified for a frame, the duration will be set equal to the difference between the start of this frame and the next one. It is mandatory to specify the duration of the last frame. For example '-frm start1:duration1,start2,start3:duration3'. Add 's' or 'm' to specify if values are seconds or minutes (seconds is the default if none provided). Maximum precision of frames is milliseconds. (default: 1 frame of the whole input file duration).           
\item \textbf{-g} \textit{path/to/file}: Give a text file defining the gating of the dynamic data. The number of gates, and number of events in each gate, must be provided using different keywords :
\begin{description}
\item \texttt{nb\_respiratory\_gates}: number of respiratory gates in the data
\item \texttt{nb\_events\_respiratory\_gates}: enter the number of events within each gate, separated by commas. If the data contains several frame (dynamic acquisition), the data splitting of each frame should be entered on a new line (1 line by frame).
\item \texttt{nb\_cardiac\_gates}: number of cardiac gates in the data
\item \texttt{nb\_events\_cardiac\_gates}: enter the number of events within each gate, separated by commas. If the data contains several frame (dynamic acquisition), the data splitting of each frame should be entered on a new line (1 line by frame).
\item \texttt{duration\_gate}: (optional) enter the duration (seconds) of each gate, separated by commas. If the data contains several frames (dynamic acquisition), the gate durations of each frame should be entered on separate line (1 line by frame).
\end{description}
\item \textbf{-aic} \textit{path/to/file}: This option will enable the Creation of Patlak Basis functions for direct Patlak Reconstruction (For nested recon look in -help-dynamic-model ). Provide text file with the Arterial Input Curve data points and time points, in two different horizontal lines starting with 'AIC\_time\_points:' and 'AIC\_data\_points:' to indicate which dataset corresponds to each line. Values must be separated by commas. Also provide a value of the total number of data points, on a new line starting with 'AIC\_number\_of\_points:'.
\item \textbf{-qdyn} \textit{path/to/file}: Provide a text file containing quantitative factors specific to dynamic frames, respiratory or cardiac gates. The file should provide factors with the keywords 'FRAME\_QUANTIFICATION\_FACTORS' and 'GATE\_QUANTIFICATION\_FACTORS'. The number of factors must be consistent with the number of frames/gates. If the data contains several frames and gates, the gate quantification factors should be entered on a separate line for each frame 
\item \textbf{-help-dynamic-model} \: Print out specific help about dynamic model
\end{itemize}
