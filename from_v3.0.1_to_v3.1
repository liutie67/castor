## New features
- Add python script to convert CASToR interfile images reconstructed with CASToR to NIfTI images. 
  (This tool is not part of the distribution, but available at http://castor-project.org/links/)

## Bug corrections, code changes, that can affect the results in some way
- Modify default tolerance factors for Joseph and Distance-driven projectors (10-4 to 10-6), 
  as it led to segmentation fault in at least one case for Joseph.
- Add Joseph and Distance-driven projectors parameters option to manually set the tolerance factor.
- Gate converter: 
  --TOF: fix max TOF measurements range calculation (set as the coincidence window if this is provided in GATE macro, or from delta time measurements if not found).
  Alternatively, one can provide it though a command line options
  --Fix bug regarding the calculation of the position of the detector surface
  (occurring when one uses negative setTranslation commands in the GATE geometry macro)
  --For histogram output: set timestamp to start time frame duration 
   (it was set to 0 by default, but since v2.2, events whose timestamp are outside the reconstruction time frame
   were ignored, leading to all events be ignored if frame start time >0
   
- All spaces in dynamic model options are now replaced with underscores
- Spectral model basis functions calculation was updated to match the bibliography methods
  , specificaly for the full trapping compoment of the basis functions. 
- Involuntary motion tags handling updated to avoid errors when motion correction time-tags coincide with dynamic frame start times.
- Quantification factors adapted for gated reconstruction ( individual gates ) , as well as additive correction for the gate-duration within each frame

## Small bug fixes
- Small fixes in general documentation
- Check of optimisation method used when using the castor-imageDynamicTools to avoid direct optimization (that is only possible for 4D recosntuctions) 
- update of help for Patlak and Spectral linear dynamic models
