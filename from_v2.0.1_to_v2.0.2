## New features
- Several additional features for the GATE conversion tools : List-mode ToF, PET scatter/random correction rates estimation and different output option regarding the coincidences.

## Bug corrections, code changes, that can affect the results in some way
- None

## Small bug fixes
- Fix bug in GATE conversion tools resulting in an erroneous ordering of PET detector indices depending on the order of the geometry command lines in the GATE macro file
- MPI management for list-mode sensitivity computation
