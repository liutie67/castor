## New features
- Add Time-Of-Flight support for both histogram and list-mode PET data.
  All projectors now have 3 different implementations: withoutTOF, withTOFBin (histogram), withTOFPos (list-mode).
- Add the distance driven projector from De Man and Basu.
- Add CT support, currently through ascii description only for flat panel detectors:
  - add the MLTR optimizer.
  - adapt the MLEM and Landweber optimizers to deal with transmission data using their log converted expression.
- Add a zoom option for SPECT monolithic block detectors. This is used during acquisition, so the zoom along with the
  total size of the detector block define the new effective size of the detector in which the acquisition bins are
  included (the rest of the detector being blind/ignored).

## Bug corrections, code changes, that can affect the results in some way
- Minor changes in projectors incrementalSiddon and Joseph.
- Add HPFLTNB float number macro definition. It is dedicated to parts of code that need high precision computation accuracy.

## Small bug fixes
- Several but not listed...
