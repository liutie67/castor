 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * CASToR is an open-source multi-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac) toolkit for 4D emission (PET and SPECT) tomographic reconstruction.
 * This is the doxygen documentation of CASToR (Customizable and Advanced Software for Tomographic Reconstruction), generated from the comment sections located in the code headers.
 * It provides a description of each CASToR class and related functions for anyone who would like to modify/implement some new features. However, it is strongly adviced to visit the website documentation page (http://www.castor-project.org/documentation) providing documentation for users and developpers, before navigating through the doxygen pages.
